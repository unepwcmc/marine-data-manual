      title: Education
      tagline: Marine datasets can tell us about our relationship with the ocean, both in terms of how it supports us, and the impact that we have on it.
      intro:
        - Marine datasets and the tools that accompany them (including mapping and data analysis tools) can be useful in both formal and informal educational settings. They can be used to further individualsâ€™ understanding of the ocean and to support the teaching of marine-related subjects.
        - For example, data layers can often be downloaded as shapefiles and used to teach students how to use mapping software, such as ArcGIS or QGIS. This provides the opportunity to work with datasets that demonstrate the current state of knowledge with regard to the ocean, while also learning new skills.
      case-study-intro: "Marine and coastal biodiversity datasets can be used alongside other datasets to support educational projects. To date, those hosted on the <a href='https://data.unep-wcmc.org' target='_blank' title='View the Ocean+ Data Viewer'>Ocean+ Data Viewer</a> have been used by:"
      case-study-bullets:
        - <strong>Academics and teachers</strong> to train students and other individuals in how to use mapping software such as ArcGIS and help strengthen their understanding of global marine biodiversity.
        - <strong>Governments</strong> to support the development of public awareness campaigns and educational displays at international meetings. These efforts have raised awareness of key marine areas of biodiversity importance.
        - <strong>Not-for-profits</strong> to improve their own understanding of marine biodiversity issues, and that of others. For example, through the hosting of workshops and training sessions.
        - The <strong>media</strong> to educate the public and raise awareness of environment and sustainable development issues. This often involves extracting key facts and figures and representing them in a more accessible manner.
        - The <strong>technology sector</strong> to increase their understanding of global environmental issues in line with their corporate social responsibilities. In turn, marine and coastal biodiversity datasets have been used to develop specialist software to tackle issues or reduce gaps in knowledge.
      resources-intro: Various tools and resources exist, which utilise marine and coastal biodiversity data for educational purposes and to raise awareness.

          title: The Importance of Mangroves to People
          content: This report provides accessible information and downloadable images on the location and ecology of mangroves. It provides a science-based synthesis of the different types of goods and services provided by mangroves and the associated risks in losing these services in the face of ongoing global habitat loss and degradation. The report provides management and policy options at the local, regional and global level with the aim of preventing further losses through effective conservation measures, sustainable management and successful restoration.
